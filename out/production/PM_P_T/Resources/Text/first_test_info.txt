Here, your reflex and eye-hand coordination will be tested.
You need to click the RED circle as soon as it appears.
If you click at the circle when the different color appears, you get -2 points.
If you click at the right moment, when the red circle appears, you gain +2 points.

Be careful, you should not click the black field. Otherwise, your total score will
be reduced by 4 points every time you click the black field.
In the examining phase you have one minute.

Good luck!
